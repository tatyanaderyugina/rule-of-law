DJT” hours before announcing a 90-day pause on his retaliatory tariffs. In response to the pause, the stock market jumped up.</td>

There is no evidence that this meets the legal definition of insider trading or market manipulation, but questions remain about who had knowledge of the tariff pause before it was public and their investment activities.</td>
