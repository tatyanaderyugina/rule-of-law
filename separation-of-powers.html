  <h1>Undermining the Separation of Powers</h1>
  <h2>The Separation of Powers</h2>
    <p>The Constitution created three co-equal branches of government to maintain a system of checks and balances on the power of each branch. The Trump Administration has regularly threatened this system by ignoring Congressional direction and judicial orders.</p>
