  <h1>Undermining the Constitution: The President's Foreign Deals</h1>
  <p>
 	  <ol>
     <li>President Trump’s company <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-qatar-deal-conflicts-saudi-arabia-emoluments-7379bee2e307d39bd43b534a05ae3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed a deal</a> to build a golf course in Qatar with a Saudi Arabian company and one owned by the Qatari government.This deal, in addition to his other global business holdings, raises questions about his ability to separate U.S. foreign policy from his own financial interests.</li>
     <li>The Trump family’s business announced that a fund backed by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-cryptocurrency-usd1-dubai-conference-announcement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United Arab Emirates would be investing $2 billion</a> in the president’s cryptocurrency. The announcement was made by Zach Witkoff, a founder of the Trump family crypto business and the son of Steve Witkoff, who is the U.S. envoy to the Middle East. This raises a litany of conflicts of interest, including regarding how the president chooses to regulate cryptocurrency and whether these business ventures will impact his approach to foreign policy.</li>
