          <td data-label="Why is this Illegal?">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 gives the president the authority to halt collective bargaining at only agencies related to national security like the CIA and FBI. This order expands to federal employees across the government like at the Departments of Agriculture and Health & Human Services.</td>

The messages were later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/cia-director-leaked-chat.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deleted from the phone</a> of the CIA director after an order from a federal judge to preserve the communications.</td>
          <td data-label="Why is this Illegal?">This likely violates the Espionage Act, which prohibits the intentional or inadvertent sharing of national defense information. It is also a violation of the <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/was-the-signal-chat-illegal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Presidential Records Act and Federal Records Act</a> — which outline a procedure for preserving communication related to official government business — as well as disobedience to the Judicial Branch.</td>
          <td data-label="Notes">It was later revealed that the Defense Secretary shared war plans on a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g8r701lrno" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second group chat</a> which included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer.</td>

          <td data-label="Why is this Illegal?">This is a violation of the American Privacy Act, which governs how the government collects, stores, and shares personal information, including between agencies.</td>
          <td data-label="Notes">DOGE has reportedly been using this information to compile a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-collecting-immigrant-data-surveil-track/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master database with all government data on individuals</a>, including sensitive biometric data, with the primary purpose of surveilling undocumented immigrants.

          <td data-label="Why is this Illegal?">It is unlikely the officials were able to conduct an assessment of nearly 1,700 employee’s responsibilities in less than 24 hours. The same judge <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-terminations-paused-trump/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">halted the firings</a> until the CFPB could provide more evidence on how the lay-offs were carried out.</td>
