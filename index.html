  <h1>Undermining the Constitution: The US Administration's Attack on the Rule of Law</h1>

  <p class="summary">
    Violating the US Constitution, engaging in illegal actions, and abusing power undermine the rule of law. 
    Protecting the rule of law is essential to maintain the foundations of democracy and a free society.

  <h2>Likely unconstitutional</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>First Amendment Violations:</strong> the right to free exercise of religion, speech, the press, and to peaceably protest.
      <ul>
        <li>Signed an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-law-firm.html?smtyp=cur&smid=bsky-nytimes">executive order that suspends the security clearance</a> of employees of specific law firms and prohibits them from entering government buildings, getting government jobs, or receiving government contracts. These law firms were targeted because of their previous work in cases opposed to President Trump or in support of his political rivals. The president cannot punish someone for their legal political work. This is a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/jenner-block-sues-us-government-following-trump-executive-order-2025-03-28/">violation</a> of the Constitution’s right to free expression and due process.</li>
        <li>Demanded that Columbia University, <a href="https://balkin.blogspot.com/2025/03/a-title-vi-demand-letter-that-itself.html?m=1">among other things</a>, oust the head of an academic department and place the department under <a href="https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-mahmoud-khalil-ice-arrests-1921e26f6b5a8585ad5cbda790846324">academic receivership headed by the White House</a> for five years or else lose over $400 million in federal funding. The Supreme Court has long held that <a href="https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/academic-freedom/">academic freedom is an extension of the First Amendment</a>, and pressuring a school to accept government control for political purposes violates the school’s right to set its own academic standards.</li>
