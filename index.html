  <h1>Undermining the Constitution: The US Administration's Attack on the Rule of Law</h1>

  <p class="summary">
    Violating the US Constitution, engaging in illegal actions, and abusing power undermine the rule of law. 
    Protecting the rule of law is essential to maintain the foundations of democracy and a free society.
  </p>  
  <p class="summary">
  "One should first suspect a democratically elected leader of autocratic legalism when he launches a concerted and sustained attack on institutions whose job it is to check his actions or on rules that hold him to account, even when he does so in the name of his democratic mandate."
